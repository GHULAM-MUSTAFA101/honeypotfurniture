Start with the sofa. A modular design is best here, yes you can play around with the size and shape depending on your space and needs. Next, add a couple of armchairs if you can fit them in. If not, pouffes are a great option here as they take up way less room. Finally, create a focal point with a coffee table.. \"<\/p>",

Knowing the budget will help you narrow down your options when it comes to the other choices that you will have to make.<\/p><p><strong>How big should a coffee table be?<\/strong><\/p><p>According to style guru <a href=\"https:\/\/stylebyemilyhenderson.com\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Emily Henderson<\/span><\/a>, a coffee table should be at least half the length of your sofa but no more than two thirds the length. This is to make sure that the proportions are right between the two pieces of furniture.Â <\/p><p>However, if your sofa has a chaise, Henderson says that the Â½ to 2\/3rds rule applies only to the length of the horizontal seat and not the length of the whole sofa.Â <\/p><p><strong>How tall should a coffee table be?Â <\/strong><\/p><p>The generally accepted rule is that the coffee table should be no taller than the height of the sofa seat, although it can be a little lower. If you want something higher than that, maybe because bending, stretching, or reaching is difficult for you, it might be better to consider a side table which can be taller.Â <\/p><p><strong>Where to put a coffee table?<\/strong><\/p><p>A coffee table should be placed with enough room around it so that it is easy for people to navigate around it. When it comes to clearance, we suggest you position your coffee table roughly 30-45cm away from the sofa. You will want to leave at least double this distance from any other furniture in the room such as your TV stand, the sideboard or even the fireplace.Â Â <\/p><p><strong>What shape coffee table?<\/strong><\/p><p>Once you know whether you need a coffee table, how big it should be and where you need to position it, itâs time to decide what shape it should be. A rectangle coffee table is a good option in a narrow space with minimal clearance room, whereas a square coffee table is a good choice if your seating is positioned well for conversations, for example a sofa and two chairs.Â <\/p><p>You might want to consider a round coffee table if you have a small living room and\/or a chaise sofa. An oval coffee table has the same benefits as a rectangular one but due to the curved edges it allows more flow in the room and there are no sharp edges which could be good if you have children.Â  <\/p>",

At this point, consider the other furniture pieces in the room and the materials that they are made of. Also think about the people who live in your home and will be using the room. This will help you decide how durable the material should be. You may not want a glass topped coffee table if you have small children for example, but this would be a great option in a small room that already has a lot of furniture as glass takes up less visual space. With children you may opt for clear acrylic instead of glass.Â <\/p><p><strong>Think about the features<\/strong><\/p><p>If you want your coffee table to work hard for the money, consider one that can perform many functions. Perhaps you need extra storage so a coffee table with storage shelves or drawers could be a good choice. Or perhaps a trunk or ottoman coffee table.<\/p><p>Maybe you need flexibility in the room so opting for a coffee table on wheels could be a good move. If you like working on the sofa or eating at the coffee table, perhaps a coffee table with a lift top is most appropriate.Â <\/p><p>Choosing a coffee table is no easy task. It adds so much to the room and depending on the size, shape, style and material, it can completely change the feel of the room. Luckily, we have a <a href=\"https:\/\/honeypotfurniture.co.uk\/living-room\/coffee-tables\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">great selection of coffee tables<\/span><\/a> on offer so you are bound to find something that meets your budget and will work well in your living room.Â <\/p><p>If you already have a Honeypot Furniture coffee table in your home, please share on Instagram and tag us with @honeypotfurniture and use our hashtag #JoinTheHive so we can see.<\/p>",
